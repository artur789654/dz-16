                    The cat (Felis catus) is a small carnivorous mammal. It is the only
                    domesticated species in the family Felidae and often referred to as
                    the domestic cat to distinguish it from wild members of the family.
                    The cat is either a house cat, kept as a pet, or a feral cat, freely
                    ranging and avoiding human contact.[5] A house cat is valued by
                    humans for companionship and for its ability to hunt rodents. About
                    60 cat breeds are recognized by various cat registries.

                    Cats are similar in anatomy to the other felid species, with a
                    strong flexible body, quick reflexes, sharp teeth and retractable
                    claws adapted to killing small prey. They are predators who are most
                    active at dawn and dusk (crepuscular). Cats can hear sounds too
                    faint or too high in frequency for human ears, such as those made by
                    mice and other small animals. Compared to humans, they see better in
                    the dark (they see in near total darkness) and have a better sense
                    of smell, but poorer color vision. Cats, despite being solitary
                    hunters, are a social species. Cat communication includes the use of
                    vocalizations including mewing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling
                    and grunting as well as cat-specific body language.[7] Cats also
                    communicate by secreting and perceiving pheromones.

                    Female domestic cats can have kittens from spring to late autumn,
                    with litter sizes ranging from two to five kittens. Domestic cats
                    can be bred and shown as registered pedigreed cats, a hobby known as
                    cat fancy. Failure to control the breeding of pet cats by spaying
                    and neutering, as well as abandonment of pets, has resulted in large
                    numbers of feral cats worldwide, contributing to the extinction of
                    entire bird species, and evoking population control.
